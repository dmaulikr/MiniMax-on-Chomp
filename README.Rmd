Chomp is mathematical game played on a rectangular grid of size MxN where M and N > 1. Chomp is a combinatorial game; therefore, it is played between two players where both players have perfect information and the game cannot end in a draw. For some basic cases like NxN boards, 2xN boards, and 3xN boards where N > 1 winning strategies exist, however, the winning strategy is unknown for larger chomp games. The purpose of this project is to make an AI that would play perfectly in a game of chomp. I will limit the board size to a very trivial board (2x2 board) but it should be very easy to scale to much larger games. I also plan to use minimax theorem to help me find the optimal route in the chomp game tree. 

The game chomp is played on a rectangular board with n rows and m columns. Where m, n > 1. The bottom left piece is poison. For example, consider the following board.  
  
**Initial Board**  
[\  ][\  ][\  ][\ ]  
[\  ][\  ][\  ][\ ]   
[p][\  ][\  ][\  ]  
  
Each player takes turns making moves until only the poison piece is remaining. A move consist of selecting any square and removing all squares above it and to the right of it. Selecting the poison square is a loss for the respective player.

**First Player's Turn**

[\  ][\  ][1 ][\  ]   
[p][\  ][\  ][\  ]  
**Second Player's Turn**  
[\  ][\  ]  
[\  ][\  ]  
[p][2][\  ][\  ]   
**First Player's Turn**  
[\  ]    
[1 ]    
[p]    
**Second Player's Turn**  
[p]  
Second player would lose in this case.     
  
It can be shown that for any rectangular board of chomp with n rows and m columns where n, m > 1 first player has a winning strategy, however, finding the winning strategy can be very difficult for large games of chomp. Currently my game Choco Chomp on the app store can only be played between 2 human players. My plan is to use the minimax algorithm to find the winning strategy to potentially add single player mode to my game. I will be using the Swift language to program since that is the language for IOS development. I will also try to do use other similar algorithms like alpha-beta search to improve the search time. Below is a simple example of the winning strategy for a 2 by 2 chomp game. The winning strategy is highlighted in red.
